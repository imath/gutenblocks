# GutenBlocks

WordPress plugin to house my personal collection of custom blocks for Gutenberg.

This block lets us add image files using their URL instead of uploading files into the Media Library.

## GitHub Gist

This block replaces the Gutenberg's one so that self embeds can also be included.

## GitHub Release

This dynamic block will display a Plugin card on your front-end to display a link to the 'WordPress ready' archive asset download (`plugin-name.zip`).
